## CoursesDB - End of Day 3 code

We updated the [courses.sql](./courses.sql) file to create the `departments` table.

We also fixed our app to use a dropdown for the departments on the `/add` route when we add a new course.

### Can you update the app to have the same functionality for the `/eidt` :question: :thinking_face:
